## How the project is being directed
The design of the logic itself could take either a simple form or a challanging one that may atke up to few weeks to fully undestand and develop.

Since there are some team members not familiar to coding, it would be perhaps be better to start with the easy logic and replace it with the advanced one later.

## The Easier Method
The easy way is to check the answers when the user(on the client side) press the check button, not showing the incorrect part.

## The Advanced Method
We are referring tho this article: <a href="https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201718555882191.pdf">
